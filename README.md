# KMeans
# PROJECT TITLE

Analysis amd prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of american mall market called as Pheonix mall,to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basis of this predict the annual income vs spending score.

# DISCLAIMER

In this particular dataset we assume annual income as the centroid and spending score from the range 1to100 called as data nodes of the cluster.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The American finance market as per the GDP of the 2011 'Phoenix_triums mall' is in the first range out of five.The owner wants to know which particular shop or product searched in different types of clusters in the entire mall.

As the data science engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcoming GDP rate based on number of clusters.

The client wants atleast top5 clusters(shops).

#CONCLUSION

Accoding to the model basis prediction using Machine Learning Algoritham KMeans clustering we found that cluster which consists of redcolor is highest cluster which attached with more than 50 Datanodes

#REFERENCES

The Model building Algorithm develop for all kinds of Cluster values.The Yellow spots represents Centroids which id max to max 3.
